	<h1 id="[Thread3]">Black Swans & Career Choices</h1>
	<h2>Cormac - 15/9/20</h2>
	<p>So I’ve been thinking. Until now, we have been very much under construction. Society has shaped us like a graduate potter with a tremor and a sense of humour. Now, having passed by way of existence, we are beginning our main contribution to reality. Naively assuming no premature deaths, this will last approximately 40 years. <br><br>

<img id="mainicon" src="css/Career_Timeline.jpg"	alt="Career_Timeline">

If your version of reality is the same as mine, then you like feeling good. Although, feeling good is more than merely feeling good, it is a complex array of emotions all working together to give the person you identify as an overall experience that they would like to be repeated. We can assume that despite variance in the complex array of emotions each of us experience, the end goal is the same. At this point lets rule out communism, I know some of you were thinking about it.<br><br>
Unfortunately, my person ( this is how I will refer to my avatar from now on, I suggest you do the same to avoid any future legal liabilities) doesn’t do altruism it does reciprocal altruism. Which means over the next 40 years there is going to have to be some give and take. <br><br>
This leads me to the main point. With our intentions to improve the world a given, and us all highly educated, it seems obvious that we should manage our give and take in the most effective and prosperous way possible. Recently I heard about a book called Black Swan. Then even more recently I found a YouTube video which had a 20min summary of the key points in the book. To give an even briefer summary, a Black Swan event is one which nobody saw coming because nobody could have known( covid-19 or the great depression) and the book talks about the financial effect of these events, which can be negative or positive.<br>  <br>
I’m not going to try explain it all here, because the video nails it, so watch it before you read on.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caPy0OZmXKs">THE BLACK SWAN SUMMARY (BY NASSIM TALEB)</a> <br>
<br>

I’m wondering if the hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive approach to investing can be used in  relation to our career choices. I feel like there is a force which sucks us towards mediocre jobs, like the one I had, with few upsides and few downsides. There was never any chance that I would make it to the top and yet there was no way I was doing poorly financially. Fast forward to now, taking covid as the black swan event , I lost everything. What seemed low risk, actually left me completely exposed to unseen events and this is something I am going to consider in the future. Just thought I’d share it with y’all.

	<h2>Cormac - 9/9/20</h2>  
	<p>Just so you know how it works, every time I add a new post it appears here. if I had more things to say and wasnt brain dead from trying to get this website to work I would mention them now but I am tired and the all is in your court. </p>

	<p>Hello all, This is my first confession. Seems like texting is a rather useless form of longterm communication, and although I would be lost without Ciaran sending shite history memes into the group at 3 in the morning, I think I might have a better idea. in the about section ( top right) I've made a tutorial of how you guys can add content to this website. If you curious about what to add, think along the lines of - What are you doing that you would like to share with the group that takes to long to explain in a text, or what would the guys be interested in knowing. for example i would be really interested if jack wrote a piece about some cool part of architecture that none of us are aware of but he could summarize nicely, or if ali had links to some cool shit or T has some philosophical thoughts he wants to share. yes it's a blog. Just add what the fuck you like as per the tutorial</p>
